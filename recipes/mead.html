    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>It's been around since viking times, but it's as good today as it was way back then. Plus, all you need is honey, water, and yeast to make it.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Quality honey</li>
      <li>A pack of Mead Yeast</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Some fruit</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix honey and water together in a container of choice.</li>
      <li>Add mead yeast and some sort of additional nutrition to the honey water mixture.</li>
      <li>Fit the airlock to your vessel and wait. The yeast will start to work, turning the sugar into CO2 and alcohol.</li>
      <li>When the bubbling stops, that tells you the first fermentation is finished.</li>
      <li>Bottle and label.</li>
    </ol>
